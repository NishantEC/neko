# neko — project knowledge

neko is a hotkey-summoned, GPU-rendered launcher for macOS, written from scratch
in Rust on [GPUI](https://gpui.rs) (Zed's UI framework). See `README.md` for how
to run it and `data/dim/plan.md` (in the firstmate home, not this repo) for the
full product plan.

## Current scope: the spine, plus clipboard history

Slice 1 was a single-crate proof that GPUI works at all. A follow-up task
restructured that proof into the plan's real five-crate workspace and built
the first end-to-end feature: **summon with a hotkey, type, see your real
applications ranked sensibly, press enter, the app launches** — on the frozen
visual design, over real system window vibrancy. The task after that added
**clipboard history as a second result type in that same list**: the daemon polls the
pasteboard, persists distinct copies, and they show up under their own
`Clipboard` section header, filterable by the same search field, restorable
to the pasteboard with enter. See "Clipboard history" below. Still not built:
onboarding UI, the WASM extension system, agent capability. See "Seams for
follow-up work" below for exactly where each plugs in.

## Crate layout

```
crates/
  neko-protocol/  pure wire types + length-prefixed JSON framing, no logic
  neko-core/      daemon-owned logic: SQLite, app index, search ranking,
                  launching, hotkey-setting persistence, the AgentProvider seam
  neko-daemon/    thin binary hosting neko-core behind a Unix socket
  neko-client/    SDK: persistent auto-reconnecting connection to the daemon
  neko/           the GPUI app — window, panel, live OS hotkey capture
```

Boundary rule the crate split exists to enforce: `neko-protocol` depends on
nothing but `serde`. `neko` (the app) depends on `neko-client` and
`neko-protocol` only — never `neko-core` — so it physically cannot reach past
the daemon boundary to touch SQLite or the app index directly.

## The daemon/client split, and why the hotkey is registered where it is

The daemon is resident, owns SQLite as the single writer (`neko_protocol::database_path()`,
`~/Library/Application Support/neko/neko.db`) and the application index, and
survives the client being killed — a fresh client process just opens a new Unix
socket connection (`neko_protocol::socket_path()`) to the same live daemon, no
handshake state required. `neko`'s `daemon_launcher` module spawns
`neko-daemon` unconditionally on client startup; the daemon's own
`bind_singleton` (in `neko-daemon/src/server.rs`) makes a redundant spawn a
no-op — it pings the existing socket and exits quietly if something already
answers, or takes over a stale socket file if nothing does.

Note for concurrent dev testing: `socket_path()`/`database_path()` are fixed
per-user paths (`~/Library/Application Support/neko/`), not per-worktree —
correct for a real single install, but if another agent/worktree building
this same repo is testing its own `neko`/`neko-daemon` at the same time on
the same machine, you'll transparently be talking to *their* daemon (or vice
versa) via the singleton check above, and a crash report for "neko" in
Console/`~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` may not be yours. Check
`pgrep -fl neko-daemon` and match the binary's actual path before assuming a
daemon-related failure is this worktree's bug.

**The live OS-level hotkey registration happens in the client, not the
daemon**, even though the daemon owns and persists the *setting*
(`neko_core::hotkey`, a `settings` KV table). This looked like it could go
either way; it can't, for two reasons: (1) `global-hotkey`'s registration
needs a live run loop, and the client is the process with GPUI's foreground
executor already polling `GlobalHotKeyEvent::receiver()` — routing the actual
keypress through the daemon over IPC would add a socket round-trip to the
exact path the ~11–14ms warm-summon budget is measured on; (2) only a live
registration attempt can prove a conflict (see below), and only the client can
make one. `neko::hotkey_client::HotkeyController` owns this; `neko_core::hotkey`
never touches AppKit/Carbon.

## The hotkey is a runtime-configurable setting, not a constant

Added mid-task, on top of the original single-crate proof's hard-coded
`⌥Space`. The daemon persists the current `HotkeyCombo` and serves it over
`neko-protocol::Request::{GetHotkey, CheckHotkeyConflict, CommitHotkey}`; on a
successful `CommitHotkey` it broadcasts `Event::HotkeyChanged` to every
connected client. `neko::hotkey_client::HotkeyController::rebind` is the real
capture mechanism: it attempts a live OS registration of the candidate first,
and only unregisters the old combo once the new one is proven live — a failed
rebind never loses the working hotkey. `neko_core::hotkey::check_known_conflict`
is a fast, side-effect-free pre-check against well-known reserved combos
(Spotlight, Mission Control, screenshot shortcuts, ...) — real but a heuristic,
not a guarantee; only a live registration attempt can catch a *third-party*
app's custom binding.

**Nothing in this codebase calls `rebind` yet** — there is no rebinding UI in
this slice (that's onboarding's step 09, "Learn the hotkey," explicitly out of
scope here). This is the seam: a future onboarding screen captures a candidate
combination, calls `HotkeyController::rebind`, and on success sends
`Request::CommitHotkey` — see `hotkey_client.rs`'s doc comments and its test
suite (`FakeRegistrar`) for the exact state machine, already covered without
needing real OS calls in the test run.

## Search and ranking

`neko_core::search::fuzzy_score` is a small, dependency-free subsequence
scorer (fzf-shaped: contiguous-run and word-boundary bonuses, a length
penalty) combined with a recency/frequency boost from the `launches` table
(`neko_core::search::rank_apps`). `rank_clipboard` reuses the same
`fuzzy_score` against each entry's content, with its own faster-tapering
recency boost (3-hour half-life vs. apps' 5-day one — a clipboard history is
inherently a "recent things" list). The daemon caps results server-side
(`Request::Search { limit, .. }`, the client asks for 8) — the client never
renders more than that, which is why the result list isn't virtualized (see
"gpui-component" below). `handle_request`'s `Search` arm gives `rank_apps`
first crack at the full `limit` and fills whatever's left with
`rank_clipboard` — apps stay the primary, unchanged-since-slice-1 result
type; clipboard is additive. One consequence worth knowing: a query that
alone matches `limit` or more apps crowds clipboard out of that response
entirely (no clipboard section renders), same as it would for a third result
type later — not a bug, just how a hard-capped shared budget behaves.

## Icons

`neko_core::icons` extracts each app's real icon via `NSWorkspace::iconForFile`
(not a loose `.icns`-file parse, which silently fails on modern
asset-catalog-only apps) and caches it as a PNG under
`~/Library/Caches/neko/icons/`. Runs once per app on daemon startup, in a
background thread *after* the app index is already searchable, so it never
delays the first search. `neko::panel` reads `SearchItem::icon_path` and
falls back to a plain placeholder square when a PNG isn't cached yet — the
list self-heals on the next search once the background pass catches up.

## Clipboard history

`neko_core::clipboard` — capture, storage, and restore all live in the
daemon, nothing in the client (`neko`) crate touches AppKit for this at all;
it's just another `Request`/`Response` pair, per the search section above.

- **Capture is a background thread the daemon spawns unconditionally**
  (`run_capture_loop`, started in `neko-daemon/src/main.rs` next to the
  icon-extraction thread), polling `NSPasteboard.generalPasteboard`'s
  `changeCount` every 400ms (`clipboard::POLL_INTERVAL`). Like
  `icons.rs`'s `NSWorkspace::iconForFile`, `NSPasteboard` needs no run loop
  for the read/write calls themselves — see the frontmost-app caveat below
  for the one place in this module that *does* need one.
- **Only `NSPasteboardTypeString` is read** — plain text and, heuristically
  or via `NSPasteboardTypeURL`, links. Images are an explicit non-goal;
  `clipboard.rs`'s module doc comment records the seam (an `Image`
  `ClipboardContentKind`, a PNG cache under `~/Library/Caches/neko/clipboard/`
  mirroring `icons.rs`, no half-built variant sitting unused in the meantime).
- **Privacy**: pasteboard content flagged `org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType` or
  `org.nspasteboard.TransientType` (the convention 1Password and other
  password managers use) is never recorded — `clipboard::is_privacy_marked`,
  pure and unit-tested, plus verified live against the real pasteboard with a
  JXA script setting those exact marker types (no password manager was
  installed on the verification machine to test against directly; say so
  rather than claim more than was checked).
- **Dedup and bound**: `content` is the SQLite primary key
  (`clipboard_entries` table), so a repeat copy is an `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`
  that moves it to the top rather than a new row. Bounded to
  `clipboard::HISTORY_LIMIT` (200) by count, not age — pruned after every
  insert. Both behaviors are covered in `db.rs`'s tests.
- **"Paste" writes the pasteboard, it does not simulate ⌘V.**
  `Request::Paste { id }` (`id` is the entry's own content) calls
  `clipboard::write_to_pasteboard` and nothing else — the frontmost app after
  neko hides still needs a real ⌘V from the user. Decided this way (not
  answered by the plan or design report) because a synthetic keystroke would
  need the same accessibility-permission machinery the brief explicitly
  scoped out ("do not build onboarding or permission-request UI"), and
  "puts it back on the pasteboard" is the brief's own literal wording.
  Bonus: because writing back is a real pasteboard change, the capture loop
  notices it on its own next tick and re-records it — a paste is
  indistinguishable from an ordinary re-copy, including the recency bump.
- **Source-app attribution is best-effort, not a guarantee**, in two
  independent ways: (1) it's whatever `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication`
  says at capture time, which can be wrong if the real copying app and the
  poll tick that notices it race (bounded by `POLL_INTERVAL`); (2) **a
  process without a spinning run loop gets a stale, frozen answer from
  `frontmostApplication`, not a live one** — confirmed with a standalone
  repro (a plain background-thread binary, no `NSApplication`/`CFRunLoop`
  anywhere, read `frontmostApplication` 16 times over 8 seconds while the
  real frontmost app was switched four times via `osascript`; every read
  returned the *first* app's name). The fix, in `clipboard::pasteboard::
  frontmost_app_name`, is a `CFRunLoop::run_in_mode(kCFRunLoopDefaultMode,
  0.05, true)` pump immediately before reading the property — confirmed live
  in the daemon binary afterward (`docs/evidence/summon-panel-clipboard-
  results.png`'s "Copied from Arc" row). **Any future code in this daemon
  that reads live AppKit/Workspace state from a background thread should
  expect the same staleness and pump a run loop first** — this is not
  specific to clipboard, it's a property of any notification-backed
  `NSWorkspace`/`NSRunningApplication` query made off a real run loop.
- **No two-column detail pane.** The design's screen 12 (`12-first-clipboard-
  use.html`) is a dedicated, wider (760px, `theme::PANEL_WIDTH_WITH_DETAIL_PX`)
  clipboard-only mode with a preview pane. This task renders clipboard rows
  inline in the one shared 680px list instead (screen 11's pattern: "one
  query, two result types, same list" — apps and clipboard each under their
  own section header, row-level type tag / source subtitle / relative-time
  accessory matching screen 12's own row treatment). The two-column mode
  stays a follow-up; `PANEL_WIDTH_WITH_DETAIL_PX` is still unused, still
  reserved.

## The `AgentProvider` seam

`neko_core::agent::AgentProvider` is exactly what the plan asked for: an
object-safe trait with a `FakeProvider` proving it compiles, registered
nowhere in the daemon's request handling. Wiring a real provider's results
into `Request::Search`'s response as more `SearchItem`s (`ResultKind` would
need a new variant) is the seam — "just another result type in the same fast
list," per the plan.

## Third-party UI code: evaluated, then narrowly vendored

`longbridge/gpui-component` (Apache-2.0, crates.io) was evaluated as a
dependency for its virtualized list, text input, and keyboard/focus handling,
and rejected as a dependency (757 resolved packages for three mechanics, a
second `cocoa`/`cocoa-foundation` Obj-C bridging stack alongside the `objc2`
one this repo already uses, and 60+ components' worth of styling opinions to
fight against the frozen bespoke tokens). One genuinely self-contained,
non-trivial piece — cursor-blink timing — was vendored instead, adapted, and
attributed: `crates/neko/src/components/vendor/gpui_component/blink_cursor.rs`.
Everything else evaluated (the virtualized list, the rope-based rich-text
input engine) was declined with reasons recorded in
`crates/neko/src/components/vendor/MANIFEST.md` — read that file before
reaching for either of those again; the reasoning (list virtualization solves
a problem this app's server-capped result list doesn't have; the input engine
is a full multi-line/LSP-integrated editor, an order of magnitude more than a
single-line search field needs) is still valid unless those constraints
change. Apache-2.0 attribution: `NOTICE`, `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES/gpui-component-APACHE-2.0.txt`.

## Design tokens

`crates/neko/src/theme.rs` is `data/neko-design/report.md` §1's token table as
literal Rust constants (the report's own `sRGB` hex column, not re-derived),
cross-checked in a test against an independently-implemented OKLCH→sRGB
conversion — all 8 base-palette tokens matched exactly; nothing in the table
looked wrong. The identity accent (`ACCENT`, `#efa831`, direction A "amber
eye") is the one named constant the captain asked for — swapping it for
direction B or C is a one-line change in that file. It's intentionally unused
by any paint path right now: the report's colour-identity pick is still open,
and v1 ships in the base neutral palette until the captain picks one.

## Window material

`crates/neko/src/material.rs` is the one-function seam the launch brief asked
for: today it returns GPUI's own `WindowBackgroundAppearance::Blurred` (real,
shipping window-level vibrancy — design report §5 "Direction 1"). The
`neko-native-material` spike (a separate, parallel task) is bridging real
`NSVisualEffectView`/`NSGlassEffectView` under a live GPUI window; when it
lands, its recommended code path replaces this function's body, nothing else.

## v1 simplification: fixed-size window, not dynamic per-keystroke resize

`gpui::Window::resize` exists, but this task had no safe way to verify its
resize-anchor behavior on a borderless always-on-top popup window before
committing to it on the hotkey-latency-critical path. `neko::panel::Root`
instead renders at one fixed size (680×448) with the footer pinned to the true
bottom via a flex-grow content area, so short result lists leave quiet space
above the footer rather than the window growing or shrinking. Documented in
`panel.rs`'s own module doc comment. Real dynamic resizing is a follow-up, not
attempted here specifically because it was untested territory on the one path
this task's acceptance criteria measures a hard number against.

## Summon latency

Re-measured after the restructure (release binary, `RUST_LOG` off — full
methodology and all samples in `docs/evidence/summon-latency.md`):

- **Warm** (window, renderer, and daemon connection already live): **~2.9–6.4ms**
  across 6 samples, mean ≈4.1ms — inside slice 1's own budget (~11–14ms) and
  faster than slice 1, despite the panel now rendering far more per frame.
  The daemon round-trip for `Search` is off the summon path entirely (summon
  is hotkey-press → first-frame-after-activation, purely client-side,
  unchanged from slice 1) — a slow or unreachable daemon cannot make summon
  itself slower.
- **Cold** (first summon after process launch): **~65–160ms** across 2
  samples — roughly double slice 1's ~89ms. This is the one place the extra
  panel content and `WindowBackgroundAppearance::Blurred` compositing
  genuinely cost something, paid once per process lifetime (the process stays
  resident — see "Current scope" above), not per summon. Reported plainly
  rather than absorbed, per the brief's own instruction.

Testing caveat carried over from slice 1: synthetic hotkey events via
`osascript … key code 49 using {option down}` are unreliable in rapid
succession (roughly half dropped between AppleScript and the OS's global-hotkey
delivery), even though every event that *did* arrive was handled correctly.
Real hardware keypresses weren't re-tested with the same instrumentation this
pass either — don't be surprised if automated re-tests need retries.

## Hotkey scoping (must never leak into other apps)

`global-hotkey`'s macOS backend registers through Carbon's
`RegisterEventHotKey`, which is an OS-level *consuming* registration — a
registered combo's keystroke is delivered to the registering process's
callback and does not also reach the focused application. This was already
true in slice 1; nothing in this task's daemon/client split or the
configurable-hotkey addition changes which API performs the registration.
Manually verified this pass: typed `BASELINE-` into a focused TextEdit
document, pressed neko's live hotkey (which correctly summoned the panel),
typed `-AFTER` back into TextEdit — result `BASELINE—AFTER` with nothing
(not even a space) inserted between the two typed strings. Screenshot:
`docs/evidence/hotkey-no-leak-textedit.png`.

## Licence rule

**Every line in this repo is written fresh**, with one documented exception:
see "Third-party UI code" above (`gpui-component`'s `blink_cursor.rs`,
Apache-2.0, attributed). `data/helm/refs/` (in the firstmate home) holds four
reference GPUI apps — `comet` (MIT), `waku` (GPL-3.0), `codux` (GPL-3.0),
`t3code` (MIT) — plus GPUI's own bundled `examples/` (Apache-2.0). All read for
architecture and API shape, never copied. The aim is MIT end to end, plus the
one attributed Apache-2.0 file.

## The GPUI dependency decision

`gpui` is Apache-2.0 as published on crates.io, but git-`main` currently links
a GPL-3.0-or-later crate (`ztracing`) through an unfixed dependency edge — see
`data/dim-licence/report.md`. **Chosen route, unchanged from slice 1: depend on
the published crate, `gpui = "0.2.2"` from crates.io — not git, no `[patch]`
block.** Re-verified again after clipboard history added `objc2-core-foundation`
as a direct dependency (`Apache-2.0 OR MIT OR Zlib`, already transitively
present via `gpui`/`objc2-app-kit`) — `docs/evidence/cargo-tree.txt` and
`docs/evidence/cargo-license.txt` are current as of that change: still no
GPL/AGPL anywhere in the tree, still only `self_cell`'s dual
`Apache-2.0 OR GPL-2.0` line, used under the Apache-2.0 arm.

To re-verify after any dependency bump:

```sh
cargo license 2>/dev/null | grep -iE '\bgpl\b|agpl'   # expect only the self_cell dual-license line
cargo tree | grep -i 'ztracing\|zlog'                  # expect no output
```

## Seams for follow-up work

- **Onboarding UI** (14-screen sequence, design report §3): drives
  `HotkeyController::rebind` for step 09; nothing else in this codebase
  assumes it exists. The panel's own first-run/empty state
  (`panel::render_empty_state`) is deliberately generic, not onboarding.
- **Clipboard history**: built — see "Clipboard history" above. Still open:
  image capture (seam documented in `clipboard.rs`'s module doc comment) and
  the two-column detail-pane mode (`PANEL_WIDTH_WITH_DETAIL_PX`, screen 12).
  No macOS permission prompt was observed gating general pasteboard reads on
  the verification machine (unlike Accessibility, there's no `AXIsProcessTrusted`-
  equivalent "is trusted" API for the pasteboard) — `read_current`'s SAFETY
  comment covers the "detect and degrade" reasoning for the day one shows up:
  a blocked read and an empty one both come back as `None`/`nil`, so treating
  `None` as "nothing to capture this tick" already is the honest degrade
  path, not a placeholder for a request flow still to build.
- **Dynamic window resize**: see "v1 simplification" above.
- **`AgentProvider` wiring**: see above.
- **Native window material spike**: see "Window material" above.
